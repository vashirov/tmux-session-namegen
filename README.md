# tmux session random name generator

This is a small program that generates a pair of random adjective and emoji to be used as a session name, similar to how [docker](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/pkg/namesgenerator/names-generator.go) generates random names for containers.

Some emojis, such as half width or with modifiers, were omitted because they are not rendered correctly in the terminal.
